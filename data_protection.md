# Privacy and Data Protection
Thank you for using peercoin-flutter.

This app treats your data very carefully.
It will connect to an electrum server and exchange transaction and blockchain related messages with it following the [electrumx-protocol](https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-basics.html "electrumx-protocol").
The data shared is essentially the same, as if you would use a peercoin full node.

Beyond that, no data will leave your device.

This app **stores all necessary data locally** on your device. 
There is **no analytics** software **or advertising** software inside.
